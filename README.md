AI Health Risk Prediction System
The AI Health Risk Prediction System is a simple machine learning web application that predicts the risk of diabetes based on user input parameters such as Glucose Level, Body Mass Index (BMI), and Age.

The system uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify whether a person is at Low Risk or High Risk of diabetes. It provides instant results through a user-friendly hospital-themed web interface.
